‚úÖ Objective:
To get introduced to the basic structure and syntax of Python, including variables, data types, and fundamental arithmetic operations. This week focused on developing familiarity with how Python handles user interaction and simple processing.

üîç Activities Performed:
Learned about Python variables and dynamic typing.

Explored various data types such as integers, floats, and strings.

Understood how to take input from users and display output using print functions.

Applied basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

üñ•Ô∏è Output Observation:
The results were displayed clearly in the PyCharm terminal. The program accepted user input and returned the computed values accordingly, confirming correct logic and syntax.

üí° Key Concepts Learned:
Syntax correctness is crucial for execution.

Input and output functions form the basic interaction of a program with the user.

Data must often be converted between types (e.g., string to integer) to perform calculations.

üß† Reflections:
This week was an eye-opener into how a programming language interprets instructions. Simple logic and arithmetic provided a comfortable entry point. There was a sense of satisfaction seeing input-output-based programs run correctly for the first time.
